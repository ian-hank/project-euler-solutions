# project-euler-solutions
Tracking all of my ways to solve the problems on projecteuler.net!

I did this as general practice and a way to prepare for dumb coding interview questions... It's setup so that multiple solutions can be added for each problem.

All solutions were coded FIRST TRY without help (I know some of them have more efficient methods of solving).

### If you want to see the solutions and time to solve each one just download the source code run the SolutionTesting class.
