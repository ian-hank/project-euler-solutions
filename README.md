# project-euler-solutions
Tracking all of my ways to solve the problems on projecteuler.net!

I did this as general practice and a way to prepare for dumb coding interview questions... It's setup so that multiple solutions can be added for each problem.

All solutions were coded FIRST TRY without any help or resources and strictly looking at my IDE. 

I know some of them have more efficient methods of solving but that wasn't the point, on some I have tried to do it in a more efficient way as a second solution :)
